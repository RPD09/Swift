## 📚 Files in Detail:

### 1. **📘 Swift Basics**

This file covers the following concepts:

- 📝 **Comments**: Learn about single-line, multi-line, and special comment tags in Swift.
- ➗ **Operators**: Understand the different types of operators, including assignment, arithmetic, remainder, and comparison operators.
- 🔒 **Constants and Variables**: Explore how to declare and use constants (`let`) and variables (`var`) in Swift, including naming conventions and Unicode support.
- 🧮 **Data Types**: Understand the various data types in Swift, such as numeric types (`Int`, `Double`, `Float`), boolean (`Bool`), and strings (`String`), including multi-line strings and escaping characters.
- 🎯 **Typing and Inference**: Learn about explicit typing and Swift's ability to infer types automatically.

### 2. **📝 Basics - Exercises**

This file includes a series of exercises designed to practice the concepts covered in **Swift Basics**:

- **1️⃣ Create a Playground**: Perform basic arithmetic operations using constants.
- **2️⃣ Refactor the Previous Exercise Using Variables**: Refactor the first exercise using variables instead of constants.
- **3️⃣ String Interpolation**: Practice string interpolation by constructing a message with variables.
- **4️⃣ Calculate Age in 2024**: Calculate age based on the year of birth.
- **5️⃣ Calculate Years Lived**: Calculate the number of years a person lived based on birth and death years.
- **6️⃣ Fix the Message with Name**: Modify a message to include a user's name.
- **7️⃣ Fix the Calculation**: Adjust an expression to achieve the correct result.
- **8️⃣ Type Conversion and Division Remainder**: Experiment with type conversions and find the remainder of a division operation.
